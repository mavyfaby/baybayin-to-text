# Baybayin to Text Converter

## Introduction

The Baybayin to Text Converter is a tool designed to help users convert Baybayin script into modern Filipino (Tagalog) text. Baybayin is an ancient Filipino script used prior to the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. This converter allows you to enter text in Baybayin and receive the equivalent Latin script (Tagalog) translation.

Whether you're learning Baybayin, studying Filipino history, or just want to use this ancient script in modern applications, this tool makes it easy to bridge the gap between these two writing systems.
